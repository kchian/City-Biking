This dataset is from the San Francisco Bay Area Bike Share database from August 2013 to August 2015. The bike share is meant to provide people in the Bay Area an easy way to travel around. The dataset is provided as a SQL database and a series of csv files.

The dataset is part of San Francisco's open data project, and bike share data from 2013 to the present is available. We focus on the beginning of the program to note program adoption.

In 2013, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) partnered with various agencies across the entire Bay Area. Bikeshares were designed to provide an equitable and sustainable form of public transit, available in subscription and per-ride payment. The aim was to allow people to make short trips by bike to avoid the notorious Bay Area traffic, and to provide options for commuters and tourists alike.

Stations were placed thorughout the bay, but mostly around other public transport options for convenience. In the periods after this dataset, various improvements were made to the program, including the addition of stationless bikes.

The database and files are available on Kaggle at the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share).
